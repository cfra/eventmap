Eventmap
========

This package is intended to allow keeping track of equipment
deployed at an event. Right now it's fairly basic, e.g. it doesn't
support multiple types of equipment.

Usage
=====

1. Setting up layers

It is assumed that you are on a terrain that might have multiple
floors. You can input floorplans as pdf or png into the layers
directory. Let your layer be called floor_1.pdf you can optionally
supply meta information for that layer by adding a file floor_1.pdf.txt.
There you can e.g. provide a name for that layer or describe how it
should be scaled translated which allows you e.g. to align multiple floorplans.

2. Generating layer information and tilesets

Run the read_layers.py script. It will look for layers in the layers directory,
render tilesets for those layers and generate a json document providing information
about the available layers.

3. Run the server

Run the run_map.py script. It will run a webservice with a map where you
can enter/edit/view deployed equipment.
